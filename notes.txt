# We need to install libreoffice if our system is linux for docx to pdf conversion to work on linux


# Also if we encounter import error for ""from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes"

    Even if you installed pycryptodome or pycryptodomex, the import can still fail if any of these is true:

        You have the wrong package installed (crypto instead of pycryptodome)
        You have both crypto and pycryptodome(x) installed → conflict
        You're in a virtual environment where the library isn't installed
        You're using pycryptodomex but still trying to import from Crypto (capital C)

    Solution
    # 1. Completely remove conflicting/broken packages
    pip uninstall crypto pycrypto pycryptodome pycryptodomex -y

    # 2. Install the correct, maintained library
    pip install pycryptodome
